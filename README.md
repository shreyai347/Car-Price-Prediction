# Car Price Prediction Web App

![Car Price Prediction](https://example.com/car_image.jpg) <!-- Add a relevant image link here -->

## Overview

Welcome to the **Car Price Prediction Web App**! This application leverages machine learning to predict the prices of cars based on various attributes such as company, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven. Built using Flask, this app provides a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to input their car details and receive accurate price predictions.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive forms for data entry.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Instant car price predictions based on user input.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Data Visualization**: Analyze historical price trends (if implemented).

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Version Control**: Git

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/car-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

1. On the home page, select the car company and model from the dropdown lists.
2. Choose the manufacturing year and fuel type.
3. Enter the kilometers driven in the designated field.
4. Click the "Predict" button to view the predicted price.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users input car details through the web form.
2. **Data Processing**: The application collects and processes the input data.
3. **Prediction**: A pre-trained linear regression model makes predictions based on the provided data.
4. **Output**: The predicted price is displayed on a new page.

## Model Training

The linear regression model was trained on a dataset containing various features relevant to car pricing. The training process involved:

1. **Data Collection**: Collecting historical data on car prices.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset and handling missing values.
3. **Feature Selection**: Selecting relevant features for the model.
4. **Model Training**: Using Scikit-Learn to train the linear regression model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE and R².
